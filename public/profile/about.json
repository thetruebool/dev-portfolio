    "about": "Hi there. I live in Azerbaijan, and I was born in 1998. (Do your own math, I am not gonna update it every yearâ€¦) I am a game developer mostly making mobile games, but not hyper-causal, never hyper-casual, never!!!!! \n\n I know there are a lot of people who like to know the person a little bit before becoming a part of the community. So here is a bit about my motivation: \n\n\n When I was a kid, I loved the mobile games that were made with java, they had stories, different levels, and environments. My favorite was the Splinter Cell platformers. You had to aim, time your actions, and use your brain to advance in the game, and it was rewarding as it was really really entertaining. It is a bummer that like 90% of the mobile games made now are not like that anymore, they are lazy, and filled with ads, I just don't like them. So I am trying to make games like the ones I used to enjoy.\n And sometimes other mini-games while I am learning new stuff, you know, to make money, to eat.\n\n And I wish to build a community with people who share the same passion for games, and game development. I plan to make more content about the abovementioned.\n\n\n",
